Here is a quick project of Chinook.
Below I have analyzed the invoices and sales of local and non local customers for 2009
--

-- Name of customers not in the US
SELECT 
    CustomerId, 
    FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, 
    Country
FROM customers
WHERE Country != 'US';
-- Customers only in Brazil
SELECT 
    CustomerId, 
    FirstName || ' ' || LastName AS FullName, 
    Company, 
    Address, 
    City, 
    State, 
    Country, 
    PostalCode, 
    Phone, 
    Fax, 
    Email
FROM customers
WHERE Country = 'Brazil';
-- Invoices of customers from Brazil
SELECT 
    c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS FullName, 
    i.InvoiceId, 
    i.InvoiceDate, 
    i.BillingCountry
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    invoices i ON c.CustomerId = i.CustomerId
WHERE 
    c.Country = 'Brazil';
-- What are the total sales for 2009?
SELECT 
    SUM(Total) AS TotalSales2009
FROM 
    invoices
WHERE 
    strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) = '2009';
-- Invoice total, customer name, country and sales names for invoice
SELECT 
    i.Total AS InvoiceTotal,
    c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS CustomerName,
    c.Country,
    e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS SalesAgentName
FROM 
    invoices i
JOIN 
    customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN 
    employees e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;
    
SELECT 
    i.Total AS InvoiceTotal,
    c.FirstName || ' ' || c.LastName AS CustomerName,
    c.Country,
    e.FirstName || ' ' || e.LastName AS SalesAgentName
FROM 
    invoices i
JOIN 
    customers c ON i.CustomerId = c.CustomerId
JOIN 
    employees e ON c.SupportRepId = e.EmployeeId;
-- In 2009 How many invoices were there?
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS TotalInvoices2009
FROM 
    invoices
WHERE 
    strftime('%Y', InvoiceDate) = '2009';
